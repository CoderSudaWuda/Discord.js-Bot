# Discord.js-Bot
An open-source Discord.js bot which provides handy and fun commands to use!  ### How to start this bot  You need to install Node.js and a text editor (like Sublime Text, Atom, or Visual Studio Code). Once finished, download this as ZIP and extract it.   After this, create a bot in Discord. Go to: `https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me`. After this, create a new application. Fill in all the credentials (bot name, bot avatar, bot description), then find and click "Create Bot". Find where it says `token` (*NOT* `secret`!), and copy that. Then, with your text editor, open the file `index.js` inside the extracted folder. Go to the end of all the lines, and you will find `client.login('token')`. Replace `'token'` with `' {your bot's token} '`, and save the file.  Now, open a CMD Prompt or PowerShell Window inside of the extracted folder, and run "node index.js". The bot is now online. Invite it to a server, and run commands!  ### Command List  This is the command list of the bot. This may be updated from time to time.   Prefix: `$`   Current commands:  None.
